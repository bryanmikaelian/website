Hi. I'm Bryan. I've been coding since 2005 and writing software, professionally, since 2010.  I currently work at Netlify as a Backend Engineer (We're [hiring!](https://www.netlify.com/careers/)).


In the past, I've worked at:

- Segment - [https://www.segment.com](https://www.segment.com)
- Librato - [https://www.librato.com](https://www.librato.com)
- BookShout - [https://www.bookshout.com](https://www.bookshout.com)
- Fellowship Tech - [https://www.fellowshiptech.com](https://www.fellowshiptech.com)


The languages I enjoy writing and for how long (in no particular order):

- Ruby (since 2010)
- Clojure (since 2014)
- Kotlin (since 2020)
- Golang (since 2015)
- TypeScript (since 2018)


I usually don't blog but when I do, I hope you find my musings entertaining or insightful. Thanks!
