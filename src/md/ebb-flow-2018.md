# Ebbs and Flows

First off, welcome to my new website! I've made a personal goal of mine, in 2018, to blog at least once a month about a given subject. I hope you all enjoy my musings and ramblings.

On Sunday, I celebrated my 1 year anniversary with my wife, April. We were discussing how much had changed since the wedding and we were both saying how it was surreal. Here we we were, eating [dinner](http://irongaterestaurantdc.com/) in DC, when one year ago, we were living in Texas and just about to go on our honeymoon. The idea of being in Maryland never crossed our minds but he we were. And it made us realize that we really don't know what the future holds. 

I've always struggled, in my life, on handling change. I enjoy the status quo and when it changes, I get hung up on the "why". When change happens, I'm tend to play out every scenario in my head. I doubt my own abilities and, sometimes, I even blame myself.

- "Why did this happen?" 
- "How could this have been prevented?"
- "Do you think I could have done something different to prevent the change?"

I eventually move on but then I'm then faced with a new change and the cycle starts anew. You can be sure that this was a cycle I went through when we moved to Maryland.

- "Did we make the right choice?"
- "Did we buy the wrong house?"
- "What if we moved to Austin instead of Maryland?"
- "What if we have to move back?"

The same cycle. The same questions. Ultimately, the same or similar answers.
